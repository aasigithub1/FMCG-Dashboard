## Introduction

Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) refer to products that are sold quickly at relatively low cost. These goods are essential items used on a daily basis, such as food, beverages, personal care products, household cleaning products, and over-the-counter medicines.

AtliQ Mart is addressing service issues before expanding to new cities.

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data on delivery performance, including timestamps for order placement and delivery.
2. **Metrics Calculation**:

   - **In-full Delivery (IF) %**: Compared the quantity ordered with the quantity delivered.
   - **On-Time In-Full (OTIF) %**: Combined both metrics to measure orders that are delivered on time and in full.
3. **Dashboard Design**: Used Power BI to design a dashboard that presents these metrics in an easy-to-understand format, with features for monitoring trends, identifying patterns, and flagging deviations from target service levels.
